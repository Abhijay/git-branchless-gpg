# Branchless workflow for Git

![Continuous integration](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

## Demo

[See the demo at asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/ZHdMDW9997wzctW1T7QsUFe9G).

## Why?

Most Git workflows involve heavy use of branches to track commit work that is underway. However, branches require that you "name" every commit you're interested in tracking. If you spend a lot of time doing any of the following:

  * Switching between work tasks.
  * Separating minor cleanups/refactorings into their own commits, for ease of
    reviewability.
  * Performing speculative work which may not be ultimately committed.
  * Working on top of work that you or a collaborator produced, which is not
    yet checked in.
  * Losing track of `git stash`es you made previously.

Then the branchless workflow may be for you instead. 

The branchless workflow is designed for use at monorepo-scale, where the repository has a single main branch that all commits are applied to. It's based off of [Facebook's hg smartlog extension](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/SmartlogExtension) and related tooling. You can use it for smaller repositories as well, as long as you have a single main branch.

The branchless workflow is perfectly compatible with local branches if you choose to use them â€” they're just not necessary anymore.

## Installation

See https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Installation.

## Status

`git-branchless` is not yet suited for general use: commits in the smartlog are not explicitly referenced in Git's `refs` namespace, which means that an unfortunate garbage collection could remove them.
